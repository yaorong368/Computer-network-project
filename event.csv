I wanted to do something memorable to let her know I was thinking of her.Since I live near a lot of mountains and take people hiking a lot, I started creating ideas centered around nature. The end result was what I call giant ""Nature Notes'.One thing led to another and soon a local TV station asked if they could do a story on my Nature Notes and how I got started. Then CNN saw the story and helped to spread it into more markets across the country.Creating giant Nature Notes became a big blessing to me and many others during the craziness of 2020.During my slide show presentation you'll learn:where I got my inspiration for Nature Notes I've createdhow to create your own Nature Noteswhat supplies are neededhow to get startedwhat do you love to dowho would you love to surprise with a customized Nature Notehow to discover your own local resourcestips and ideas of making a really memorable Nature Notehow to promote a Nature Note through social mediawhat to wear if you are in one a Nature Notehow to get co-workers, friends, family or students involvedConsider purchasing a Nature Note Starter Kit for $39 (includes shipping) if you want to get the most from this class.Creating nature notes are a clever, unique way to cheer someone up or express your love.I'll leave time toward the end of the hour for Q & A.Once you make your own Nature Note, please send it to me so I can share it with many others!I love seeing the creations of others."

Hydroponic growing removes the need for soil, eliminating soil-borne diseases and pests, weeds, and the use of herbicides and pesticides, while producing 10 times the amount of vegetables as traditional farming. Hydroponic systems also reduce water waste and the amount of natural resources needed to grow while allowing complete control over climate, nutrients and growing conditions.This class is a great for children or adults who love growing plants during the cold, winter months because these plants are grown indoors using very little space!I like growing vegetables but herbs, flowers, and fruits can also be grown.Whether you are thinking about trying a new skill or possibly learning what it takes to create income as a commercial grower, I'm eager to share my experience and resources with you and help you get started!No prior skills, experience, talent or knowledge is required.I'll present a slideshow which will take up most of the hour.

But just like any gift you want to give someone, it depends a lot on whether they are willing to receive it.I hope people will receive my gifts through a variety of ways that I am trying to bring people together. I do this through online meetings and classes, in-person activities, adventure trips near and far, events, outings, get togethers, etc.Much of what I do is centered around helping people be active outdoors with others. Since this is not always possible I'm very grateful for Zoom and my indoor, online classes and meetings.These online resources are a great way to ""break the ice"" so when you do meet someone in person that you have been able to get better acquainted with online, the relationship is a lot more comfortable from the minute you meet them!Online meetings and classes are safe and easy ways to start developing connections with others but the end goal is to do things together in-person.MEETUP has a slogan I enthusiastically endorse:""We believe in one simple idea: when we do things with real people in real life, powerful things happen.""I hope you feel the same way and will attend this meeting often.I also encourage you to introduce yourself on the Chat Board while I am giving my slideshow presentation. You'll continue to keep your mic off as you do this.Introduce yourself by telling me where you live. Include any hobbies, strengths, skills, talents, interests, etc.Also share what you are in need of or would like in this new year! You can send me a private text if you prefer. As always, be kind and respectful in your comments.As you start to engage and open up, others will get to know you, notice what they have in common with you and want to connect with you. By knowing a little more about each other, we can help each other so much better.Coming only once is not nearly as productive as coming often!The more your presence is felt, the more we are able to get to know you and vice versa.I look forward to your support and being able to meet you!See you soon!https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86862085826"

As an experienced hiker, I've had many years to test a wide variety of traction devices while hiking during the winter months. I absolutely love Kahtoola MicroSpikes because I can enjoy a hike or walk without wondering if the icy surface below me is going to make me slip and fall!I sell these Microspikes for a discount, brand new in the box. Regular price is $70 but your Discounted Price is just $50. I have all sizes in stock: Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large. One color: BLACK.In this 30 minute online class I'll show you when to wear spikes and when to wear snowshoes. In Utah, we always use Spikes more than we wear snowshoes.We may wear them from October through June, depending on the snowpack. They are durable and will last for years!It only takes one fall on ice and you could be out for a few months or longer.$50 is also a lot cheaper than a hip replacement from falling!It's easy to put them on your shoes or boots and then take them off again.I'm in Holladay, Utah, 84117 if you are able to pick up a pair. If not let me know and I can ship them to you. A shipping fee will be added.

Touted as a classic among marriage books, Love & Respect reveals why spouses react negatively to each other and how they can deal with conflict quickly, easily and biblically. A New York Times best-seller with over 2.1 million copies sold.Cracking the communication code between husband and wife involves understanding one thing: that unconditional respect is as powerful for him as unconditional love is for her. It's the secret to marriage that every couple seeks, and yet few couples ever find. While both men and women deserve both love and respect, in the midst of conflict the driving need for a woman is love and the driving need for a man is respect. When either of these needs isn’t met, things get crazy.Based on over three decades of counseling, as well as scientific and biblical research, Dr. Emerson Eggerichs and his wife, Sarah, have taken the Love and Respect message across America and are changing the way couples talk to, think about, and treat each other. If you want to feel peace, closeness, value, and to experience marriage the way God intended, this book will help you get there.""Amazon link to purchase your copy --> https://www.amazon.com/Love-Respect-Desires-Desperately-Needs/dp/1591451876/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1643986924&sr=8-1"

Dissolved in the water is 1200 pounds of pharmaceutical-grade Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate). This extremely dense solution enables people of all body types to float effortlessly and escape the pull of gravity.The sensory deprivation tank is designed to eliminate all outside distractions, so you feel like you're floating in space, losing track of where your body ends and the water begins. Once you are settled in the tank, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between parts of the body that are in contact with the water, and those that aren’t, in effect tricking the brain into believing that you are floating freely in mid-air. The reduced stimulation provided by the float pod refocuses the individual’s attention to internal stimuli.At first this includes the novel sensations of floating effortlessly in darkness and quiet, but slowly both mind and body are led towards a deep state of relaxation. This relaxation is augmented by the full body absorption of magnesium from the water that elicits the release of muscle tension.As physical sensations become less noticeable, thoughts can become more noticeable. Eventually even the parade of thoughts subsides and the mind enters a deep meditative state.Floatation therapy has been academically studied in the USA and in Sweden with published results showing reduction of both pain and stress. At the moment there have been 80+ studies done on the benefits of floating. It is recommended to float three to five times to initially understand the process of floatation and begin to reap its long-term advantages. The benefits are cumulative, which explains why floatation devotees incorporate floating as part of their rest and recovery routines.Float Price $69.00 1-Hour (They offer GROUPONS.

Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?A dazzling novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality.

Would any of these other lives truly be better?In The Midnight Library, Matt Haig’s enchanting new novel, Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place."

We will spend August reading Blood Grove by Walter Mosely and meet online to discuss in September.Walter Mosley’s infamous detective Easy Rawlins is back, with a new mystery to solve on the sun-soaked streets of Southern California.Ezekiel “Easy” Porterhouse Rawlins is an unlicensed private investigator turned hard-boiled detective always willing to do what it takes to get things done in the racially charged, dark underbelly of Los Angeles.But when Easy is approached by a shell-shocked Vietnam War veteran-a young white man who claims to have gotten into a fight protecting a white woman from a black man-he knows he shouldn’t take the case.Though he sees nothing but trouble in the brooding ex-soldier’s eyes, Easy, a vet himself, feels a kinship form between them. Easy embarks on an investigation that takes him from mountaintops to the desert, through South Central and into sex clubs and the homes of the fabulously wealthy, facing hippies, the mob, and old friends perhaps more dangerous than anyone else.Set against the social and political upheaval of the late 1960s, Blood Grove is ultimately a story about survival, not only of the body but also the soul."

And most couples don't ever untangle it. **But you can.*** What's actually at the root of this struggle? Surprisingly, it's your attachment style, an unconscious blueprint for closeness which was formed in your first 18 months of life. *Attachment issues get really deep between lesbians -- so even if you've learned about attachment styles elsewhere, you probably haven't learned it the way we teach it in the Conscious Girlfriend Academy, specifically for lesbians and queer women.

(And yes, these tools work whether you're single or in a relationship!)* Learn and practice the magic words and phrases that will help you restore connection with a partner whose attachment wounds have come up, even if she's angry or blaming you -- and even when you're triggered, too.Attachment wounds are the hidden cause of most painful relationship challenges --and until now, you may have responded by trying to compromise, stuffing your feelings, criticizing your partner or attempting to change her.**These approaches don't work.

You have the same body, so you automatically know what to do."" When I share that line with lesbians, we all just laugh. If only!In fact, one of the deepest joys and challenges of having sex with women is that we are each so different -- and not only are we different from each other, each of us is also different at different times.Given that, how can you learn to be a great lover to any woman, and help any woman be a great lover to you? (And be a great lover to yourself, too?) That's what we'll go over in this class. Conscious Girlfriend provides intelligent, compassionate, frank, and affirming sex education to lesbians and queer women all over the world, so whether you've been sexual with women for decades or are brand new to lesbian sex, there will be something for you in this class.Among other topics, we'll cover:— How can you identify what really turns you on, and how can you have more of it?-- And how can you learn what really turns her on and help her have more of it, too?— What makes sexual communication so vulnerable, and how can you open up new worlds of possibility with words?— Here's the truth: in general, what you do isn't as important as how you do it, especially with women. You've probably already experienced that the very same activities can feel amazing, boring or even painful. So, what are the real factors that lead to pleasure?— What about sex after menopause, when you, or she, or both of you, have hormonal changes, physical challenges, or just a libido that operates differently from the way it used to?— If you haven't had much or any sexual experience with women, that can actually be an advantage. We’ll talk about why. (But don’t worry, if you’ve got lots of sexual experience with women, you can use that to your advantage, too, as long as you understand these principles!)— Oral sex: why some lesbians love it and others don't, and how to expand your range of possibilities, if you choose.— Did you know that women are capable of more than 12 kinds of orgasms? Learn more about your body's amazing pleasure capacity—and hers.Join us for a fun, empowering and liberating sex-positive experience that helps you be a great lover to any interested woman—including yourself :) Please note: this event is ONLY for self-identified women who love women, or want to.

675,consciousgirlfriendatlanta,283673407,www.meetup.com/consciousgirlfriendatlanta/events/283673407/,"This event will be on Thursday, February 10, from 5:00 - 6:30 PM Pacific Time (please convert for your local time zone!)I’m Ruth Schwartz, founder of Conscious Girlfriend Academy, an international resource teaching lesbians and queer women about conscious dating, relationships and sex. All self-identified women who love women, or want to, are warmly welcome. And whether you've been out for decades or are new to loving women, there's a lot to know in order to have the most fun, the most love, and the least heartache and confusion. Your heart is worth it! So, please join us.Here's some of what we'll cover:— Why so many lesbians say we ""don't date"" -- we just feel a spark and dive in -- and why that approach is both so uniquely compelling between women, and also such a bad idea.— Why so many lesbian connections start out amazing and then crash within just a few months -- and how to avoid that.— How do you know if she's interested? How do you know if you're interested? What's the difference between a ""friend date"" and a ""date?"" Who asks who is out? What if you're not even sure she's into women?— In these COVID times, how can you even meet women to date? What are the pros, cons, dangers, and opportunities of online dating?— What about long-distance dating? What do you need to watch out for?— How long should you flirt, sext, or get physical (whether IRL or online) and why? (Hint: the dynamics are completely different around this between women than they are between men and women, so if you're new to dating women, this is crucial to understand.)— What does it even mean to ""date?"" Is ""dating"" about looking for an LTR, or just looking for a ""see where it goes"" connection? Why do so many women get tripped up by this, and what to do instead?— We'll also cover the three essential compatibility factors for relationships between women, and why Level 3 is most likely not on your radar but is the most important of all.Join us for an enlightening, empowering and fun conversation that will also make a huge difference in your love life.**This event is being sponsored by HelloRevel, a community-building platform for women over 40.**For more information about the love- and life-changing work of Conscious Girlfriend, visit us at https://www.consciousgirlfriendacademy.com -- We have free classes for you to watch, a free Ebook on Five Heartbreaking Mistakes Lesbians Make And What To Do Instead, and lots of amazing classes for you to purchase, too, including Lesbian Dating Deep Dive, Lesbian Bed Life, Surviving and Thriving After a Lesbian Breakup, and much more. We're the compassionate, intelligent learning community for all self-identified women who love women, or want to."
676,consciousgirlfriendatlanta,283559117,www.meetup.com/consciousgirlfriendatlanta/events/283559117/,"A FREE, Special Pre-Valentine's Event for women and non-binary people!Sunday, February 6, 1:00-2:30 p.m. Pacific TimeJoin Conscious Girlfriend Academy Director Ruth Schwartz in intimate conversation with queer sexual pioneer Caffyn Jesse, speaking about expanded orgasm, sexual pleasure over age 60, transforming trauma and pain through the power of eros, erotic friendships, and bringing boldness into our eros at this time of life. Whether you're single, coupled or anywhere in between, there will be a valentine here for you.Come talk about how you can create an erotic life filled with pleasure, joy and healing—whether you are single or coupled, and at any age, with any history, in any body.Selections from Caffyn’s FaceBook Blog:""As I've grown old, I've found ways to play with erotic energy that are more joyfully chosen, deeply experienced, and supportive of complex attachment. Sometimes I have a concentrated way of feeling my arousal energy. I want and choose to feel my Eros energy as fierce and focused... penetrative. Other times, I can access a diffuse, expanded, welcoming way of being with my erotic energy. I soften and swell. In trustworthy environments, in trustworthy relationships, my erotic energy can deepen into surrender... as extended climax states go on emerging... """"As a queer person, a sex worker, a survivor of violence and a person on the spectrum, there are many ways I have been hurt and harmed. I have failed to meet others' needs and expectations. I will never belong in the world of normative belonging. And yet, in the relational world I am blessed to live in, I find and forge a better belonging.""More about Caffyn and Ruth:Caffyn is a widowed lesbian who has had to reclaim her own erotic pleasure in the wake of trauma and neglect. They are a widely-respected teacher of sexuality and intimacy, author of many books including Science for Sexual Happiness: A Guide To Reclaiming Erotic Pleasure, and a visionary in Somatic Sex Education and Sexological Bodywork. >>Visit her website www.erospirit.ca for a free course on ecstatic erotic massage, and many other resources. Caffyn refers to her vulvodynia, a painful condition resulting from an assault, as a ""holy pain"" that led her to develop counter-normative ways of accessing erotic ecstasy.Ruth is the director of the Conscious Girlfriend Academy and the author of eight books, including Conscious Lesbian Dating and Love. She donated a kidney to her then-partner in 1995, has known chronic illness in her own body and the bodies of many people she has loved, and has had some of her most powerful sexual experiences fully clothed and/or without physical touch. She has a Ph.D. in Transpersonal Psychology, is a certified Somatica Method Sex Intimacy Coach, has taught at many universities, and is a passionate student of sex, love and mystery.

See if you can relate to any of the following:-- You're smart, thoughtful, conscious, spiritually-oriented, and have high standards, so you wonder whether you could actually meet your match on a dating site, but you don't know how else to find her.-- You've put off online dating because you're just not sure how to do it -- which apps to use, what to say in your profile, how to reach out, how to protect yourself from people who misrepresent themselves, and how to keep your heart safe.-- Or you're already online, but it's not working for you. You spend too much time swiping, don't see many women who meet your criteria, and often don't hear back from the few women who do.-- You've had painful relationships in the past, so you're wary about dating. You wonder if you can really trust yourself to know who's right for you. Chemistry matters, but you also don't want to get fooled by it.-- You feel too old to waste your time, but too young to live the rest of your life alone. A little voice inside you sometimes says, Who am I kidding? There's no one out there for me.-- You wonder if it even makes sense to look for love again. You've got a pretty good life being single, so shouldn't that just be enough? Yet your heart won't let you give up.If you can relate to any of that, you are soooo not alone! Here's the truth:💜 When you know how to do online dating right, it makes a world of difference. The Find True Love Online class will help you feel confident, sure about what you seek and what you offer, and able to trust yourself and love.💜 Online dating sites and apps want you to just keep swiping forever, so you'll keep paying them. The Find True Love Online class will teach you how to make the dating sites and apps work for you rather than against you, so you can find real connection much faster.💜 Compatibility is complicated, especially when you're over 50.

She's funny, she knows her stuff, and she'll help you break through your barriers and fears to really asking for what you want in bed!Here's what Marcia has to say (excerpted from her website, www.askingforwhatyouwant.com)EVERYONE SAYS THE WAY TO MIND-BLOWING SEX IS TO COMMUNICATE.Ha. Yeah right. YOU’RE ADORABLE.That’s freaking HARD.The challenge of asking for what you want starts inside: knowing what you want, feeling safe enough to ask for it, and then literally knowing the words to use that accurately describe what you want.Then, you have to get it across to your partner without hurting anyone’s feelings or missing the point.And what if something isn’t working for you and you need to talk about that?“Just communicate” indeed.If you don’t know what you’re doing, that sounds like a recipe for disaster. Better just stay quiet, right?Well, no, because that pretty much guarantees you won’t get what you want. Wishing and hoping won’t make it so. Neither will mind-reading. (You’ve probably already tried that anyway.)YOU GOTTA GET SOME SKILLS.Bedroom communication skills.Fortunately, I got you covered.Over the 17+ years I’ve been a sex educator and relationship coach, I’ve heard from thousands of people about what keeps them from asking for what they want in the bedroom, and helped adults with all kinds of sexual interests figure out their desires and how to talk about them.Now, I’ve put it all together for you, distilling the most relevant and practical tools for you to ask for — and get — what you really want in bed. In this LIVE online workshop, you’ll learn practical, immediately-useful skills to uncover what really turns you (and your partner) on and talk about it, so that you’re WAY more likely to get it.The class is fun, and the homework is sexy.Here's what you'll learn:- Why we don't ask, and what we do instead- One thing that ALWAYS tells you when somebody wants something (even when they can't ask for it)- How to notice, trust and value your desires- Concrete tools to open up dialogue with your partner(s) about what you both like and want- Giving feedback in productive and sexy ways- Why ""Is this okay?"" is the LAST question you want to ask- How to communicate what you want, without having to talk about (all of) it- What to do about the sometimes-challenging emotions that come up around sex and desire.*****Please note: Conscious Girlfriend has Meetup groups around the world, and sometimes the date and time gets messed up across time zones.

Why don't other people just give to you what you give to them?-- When you do ask for something, it might come out like a complaint or demand or just have a lot of extra charge to it, because you've held it in for so long.-- Even when you do ask for what you want, you don't necessarily get it, so it can sometimes feel like it's not worth the trouble to ask.-- Sometimes the people to whom you given so much don't seem as appreciative as you wish they were.In this class we'll discuss and then practice tools from the Wheel of Consent, a simple yet profound tool for learning how to both give and receive in ways that feel nourishing and satisfying to you and others.Join us for The Art of Giving & Receiving, 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM PT (please convert for your local timezone, if you are not on Pacific Time) Saturday, December 4.NOTE: The formal class meeting is from 10:00-11:30 AM PT.

If there is reciprocity, humhum connects you following the experience.No, in that it's not ""speedy."" It's designed to slow down the date experience just enough so that you can tune into your heart, mind, and body, and into the connection you're experiencing with the individuals you meet.Q: Who will be there? Who might I meet?A: All self-identified women who love women, or want to, are welcome. At least half of our participants are over 50 and in the western US, while others are younger and all over the US, Canada, and other countries too. NB folx who are comfortable in an environment centering women-loving-women are welcome, too.Q: Meeting strangers is hard for me. Should I still come?A: The thoughtful facilitation and prompts provide structure; we'll also talk about how to cultivate both openheartedness and discernment so that you can feel resilient and well-resourced and at ease, even as you take the risk of meeting new people. Overall, it's probably the most comfortable way to meet other single lesbians and queer women in a context that could easily lead to dating.Q: Will I get to meet women/NB folx who are in my age range, my local area, my preferred gender expression, etc.?A: humhum will do their best to match attendees with some attention to your preferred dating age range and your geography. We do urge you to see what can be softened in your fixed dating preferences, and where connection actually occurs, as opposed to where you tend to expect or prefer it. You may well meet someone whom you'd want to date -- but even if you don't, you'll gain meaningful experience to help your dating process.Q: Who are humhum and Conscious Girlfriend, this event's co-sponsors?A: humhum is a virtual platform for process-centric conscious dating and connection. They host group and 1:1 facilitated experiences at the intersection of dating, connection and wellbeing, and they weave in mindfulness, movement, and conscious dialogue conversation styles to support you to connect meaningfully and playfully with others. They help you practice connecting with curiosity and presence in service of your intention to date, while releasing attachment to outcomes.Conscious Girlfriend is the leading global resource helping lesbians and queer women have the fulfilling, healthy dating, relationship and sex lives we want.

What makes the difference? And how can we have much more fulfillment, and much less frustration?Sex matters. Your erotic life matters. But for lesbians and queer women, it has been almost impossible to find frank, intelligent, compassionate sex education that speaks to our experiences and needs.That's why Conscious Girlfriend's Lesbian Bed Life programs exist!Here's just some of what we'll cover in Understanding & Embracing Your Erotic Self on Saturday, December 4:-- How to ""de-shamify"" and honor your erotic nature and overcome or work with the challenges imposed by homophobia, sexual shaming and trauma.-- How to understand the role of sexual fantasies, and how they can serve you not only in sexual turn-on, but also in healing.-- Why deep sexual satisfaction has little to do with ""who does what to whom,"" specific techniques, and even orgasm -- and what research shows really does make for great sex.-- The five most common turn-on templates, and how and why knowing your own can give you a powerful route to arousal and fulfilling sex.-- How knowledge of the templates can help crack the code of sexual incompatibility, as well as help you be an amazing lover to others.-- What really causes many cases of ""lesbian bed death,"" and what the remedies are.Why We're Doing ThisI personally know the deep pain of having sexual desire and longing, but feeling sexually unfulfilled and even hopeless about ever getting my needs met.That frustration led me to three years of intensive training at the Somatica Institute and becoming certified as an experiential sex and intimacy coach in the Somatica Method. In the process, I learned soooo much about sex and about myself as a sexual being. Yet every single day, I also keep learning more!I see sex as one of the most powerful aspects of being human - a minefield of joy and trauma and shame and the possibility of profound connection and healing.And I see teaching and learning about lesbian sex, in particular, as a radically self-affirming act for our community.That's why I'm so passionate about making high-quality, affirming, open-minded sexual education and help available to self-identified women who love women, or want to. Non-binary folx are welcome, too.Join us for Understanding & Embracing Your Erotic Self, 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM PT (please convert for your local timezone, if you are not on Pacific Time) Saturday, December 4.NOTE: The formal class meeting is from 10:00-11:30 AM PT.

Amicalola, which is Cherokee for “tumbling waters,” boasts seven cascades and, at 729 feet, is the tallest waterfall in the state.This hike has 1208 stairs total, so is strenuous in that sense. From the parking lot at the base, there is a half mile hike up to the viewing platform, which includes a moderately steep ascent + 179 stairs. From there, it is an additional 425 stairs to the top where you can look out over the entire valley, then 604 stairs and trail descent back to the bottom. There are plenty of landings and places to rest.We will meet at the Walmart Holly Springs parking lot, exit 14 off 575N. From there we will carpool to Amicalola Falls State Park. We will depart at 9:45 AM. There is a $5 parking fee or you can use your Georgia State Park parking pass.You will need to pack a picnic lunch. After we hike up to the top and back down, we will drive up to the Lodge and enjoy our picnic lunch from the viewing deck. From there, it is a 15-20 minute drive to BJ Reece Apple Market where we will shop the huge selection of apples which can be purchased by the bag or bushel, apple cider, apple cider donuts, pies and pastries, as well as a large selection of home made salsas and jams.From there we will head back to the Walmart parking lot.See you there!"

He was a competitive swimmer for almost 12 years and after barely missing out on the 2000 Olympics he began dedicating his time and passion to a different kind of preforming. He has been working in the industry since his years at Indiana University in the theatre/music department after which he promptly moved to New York City to further his career. He worked on multiple musical productions as a performer and several off Broadway musicals as a director. It was only after working on a popular ""Daytime T.V."" show for several years that he realized his true passion for working with people from the other side of the camera. Soon Hunter was working on multiple productions in front of and behind the camera. Once he got his first taste of the directors chair, there was no turning back. Hunter now has a home in Bloomington Indiana where he works for several multi media companies and teaches at a local preforming arts academy when he isn't busy on a film set.Location:BAZATI550 SOMERSET TERRACEATLANTA, GEORGIA 30306BAZATIATL.COM404.795.8343"

Clyde Chabot assisted François Michel Pesenti from 1989 to 2006. She has created multidisciplinary performances in the Communauté inavouable since 1992.Clyde Chabot works through the framework of the theatre company The Communauté inavouable, created in 1992. Clyde Chabot stages texts of contemporary authors and, since 2005, her own texts on the dysfunction of love (Another Medea, Time of boys), political utopias and the fall of utopias (How the body is touched), identity and origins (SICILIA [Famiglia Mia], TUNISIA, CHICAGO-reconstitution, A Soldier’s daughter, His Singularities), friendship (Childhood’s friend).

Highlights from her partnership with the Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra include acclaimed performances of Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7, Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 6 and a complete cycle of Beethoven’s symphonies.Also one of today’s most esteemed contraltos, she has done more than 80 recordings and received the most prestigious awards.

Our docent will also take us to visit the Shaheen Collection of French Works, also en français. The Shaheen Collection was donated by private individuals to include in the High's permanent collection and features works by famous French painters.Afterwards, for those who want to stick around, we'll go across the street to Politan Row (located at Colony Square) for drinks and a bite to eat.🍜🥣☕🍷🍸1. POSTCARDS FROM PARIS:In 1925, photographer André Kertész arrived in Paris with little more than a camera and meager savings. Over the next three years, the young artist carved out a photographic practice that allowed him to move among the realms of amateur and professional, photojournalist and avant-garde artist, diarist and documentarian. By the end of 1928, he had achieved widespread recognition, emerging as a major figure in modern art photography alongside such figures as Man Ray and Berenice Abbott. During this three-year period, he chose to print most of his photographs on carte postale, or postcard paper. Although this choice may have initially been born of economy and convenience, he turned the popular format toward artistic ends, rigorously composing new images in the darkroom and making a new kind of photographic object.Postcards from Paris is the first exhibition to bring together Kertész’s rare carte postale prints. These now-iconic works offer new insight into his early, experimental years and reveal the importance of Paris as a vibrant meeting ground for international artists, who drew inspiration from each other to create new, modern ways of seeing and representing the world.2. SHAHEEN COLLECTION OF FRENCH WORKSThrough the generosity of numerous collectors, benefactors, and supporters, the High Museum has assembled a distinguished collection of European art ranging in date from the fourteenth through twentieth centuries. The collection of paintings displayed in this installation represent the accomplishment of Doris and Shouky Shaheen. Collected over a span of four decades, these works were presented as a gift to the High Museum in 2019.The Doris and Shouky Shaheen Collection focuses on French art of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Within this timeframe, the paintings represent an array of styles, including the pre-Impressionist realism of Eugène Boudin’s harbor views, the shimmering Impressionism of Claude Monet’s and Camille Pissarro’s landscapes, and the expressive modernism of Amedeo Modigliani’s and Henri Matisse’s figure studies.PARKING OPTIONS:Woodruff Arts Center Parking Garage - ($16) located on Arts Center WayPromenade parking garage, located on 15th StreetBoys & Girls Club, located on Peachtree Street across from the Woodruff Arts Center.For those who don't mind the walk, there may be FREE street parking available if you park in the neighborhood on 15th Street or Peachtree Circle NE.

All registered people will receive free access to Vimeo to watch the film (no Vimeo account needed). You can watch the trailer [here](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/fightingforrespect/598475455).On Thursday, March 3 at 6:30 PM Alliance Française DC will host associate director Julia Browne to discuss the documentary. This conversation will be on Zoom and all registered people will receive a join link.### **This streaming and discussion is being made available for free to everyone so that more people can understand this important part of Black History.**### **Donations are welcome and will help cover the cost of the film’s copyrights and the speaker’s fee. Thank you for your consideration.***About the speaker:*Julia Browne pioneered Black heritage tourism in France in 1994. She was born in Britain, raised in Canada, and resided in France for fifteen years. In Paris, she founded the heritage education company Walking The Spirit Tours-Black Paris & Beyond while a student at the Sorbonne’s Center for African American Studies. Her Afrocentric tours and customized itineraries have introduced countless travelers, students, and educators to the rich but lesser known influence of Black history and culture in Europe, the UK, Washington DC, and Canada.Julia is also an award-winning broadcaster and a captivating speaker. She is the associate producer Blue Lions Films' documentary *[Paris Noir – African Americans in the City of Ligh](https://bluelionfilm.com/product/paris-noir-institutional-purchase/)t* and *[Fighting For Respect – African American Soldiers in World War 1 France](https://vimeo.com/641683668)*. Since 2016 she has been invited to speak on France's Black history at cultural organizations American Embassy Washington DC, the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History & Culture, film festivals, educational institutions and special screenings in the U.S., Canada and Europe.*About the film*USA/FRANCE / 2021 / 54 MIN / DOCUMENTARY / ENGLISH""Serving in France, three-quarters of the 200,000 soldiers ended up far from the battlefields - relegated to labor battalions performing brutal menial and low-level duties. While at the same time, the 'luckier' ones gained invaluable training while 'loaned' to the flagging French Army where they proved their mettle on the Front, many earning medals of distinction.Regimental bands accompanied those combat units and kept up the morale of the troops right there on the frontlines and in concerts - spreading encouragement and African-American culture through their own music - jazz.Convinced that their much-praised heroism overseas would translate to civil rights at home, the returning veterans and their communities instead became the target of unspeakable violence waged by white supremacists during the fiery Red Summer of 1919.The complexity of this gripping story is retold through rare archival film footage, letters written home from the Front, live walks through former battlefields and incisive commentary from academic experts including Tyler Stovall (Fordham University), Chad Williams (Brandeis University), Adriane Lentz-Smith (Duke University), Jennifer Keene (Chapman University). In addition, the focus on the experiences of several distinguished soldiers provides thought-provoking insight as to how African American participation abroad advanced the fight for equality, respect and freedom in the United States."""

Rather, the law is French universalism; one is first of all French, and that all other identifiers and affiliations dissolve under this title. Many contemporary scholars, artists, and activists have pushed back against this approach to Frenchness, one that fails to describe the lives and experiences of many modern-day French citizens. At the forefront of this debate is filmmaker, writer, and professor Mame-Fatou Niang, whose 2015 documentary Mariannes Noires looks at French women who are not fully described by universalism.Highlighting seven French-born women of African and Caribbean descent, Niang’s documentary asks if an essence of Frenchness can be understood through their varied professions and experience. From filmmakers and dancers, to entrepreneurs and teachers, Niang’s inquisitive and open approach leads viewers through a rich cultural landscape, allowing Black French women to voice their experiences and perspectives on the enigma of French identity.About the speaker:Mame-Fatou Niang is a filmmaker and professor of French and Francophone studies at Carnegie-Mellon University. Her work is on contemporary France, Sub-Saharan Africa, postcolonialism, media studies, and urban planning. Her documentary Mariannes Noires, which focuses on the Afro-French identities of seven women, was selected for the San Francisco Black Film Festival, Toronto Black Film Festival, and Festival International du Film Black Montréal, among others.*The discussion will be available both online and in person. While the conversation will happen in person (Niang will appear in the Reading Room), the Library will stream the conversation on Zoom for a live viewing experience. Both in-person and online attendees will be able to pose questions.Black History Month 2022 has been curated in partnership with The Californien Agency which serves as a consultant and strategic adviser to artists and creative enterprises. The Library would especially like to thank Patrick Banks and Little Africa Paris, Black History Month 2022’s media partner."

Though the series has received a blend of love, curiosity, as well as sometimes vitriol, a particular target of public attention has been the character Sylvie Grateau (played by Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu), who heads the marketing agency that reluctantly hosts Emily Cooper (played by Lily Collins), the show’s guileless American heroine.Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, a seasoned French actress who plays the effortlessly chic and compellingly mean antagonis-turned-friend, believes that her character is more complicated than the stereotypes to which public opinion has reduced her. In a recent New York Times profile by journalist Elaine Sciolini, she defended the show’s lack of realism, and explained her method and inspirations for stepping into Sylvie’s strappy shoes. In an exciting evening for expat and French viewers alike, Leroy-Beaulieu and Sciolini will continue their conversation on femininity, age, style, and mean (and nice) Parisians at the American Library. Join the two women as they discuss the trajectory of Leroy-Beaulieu’s career, the cultural aftershocks of “Emily in Paris,” and her experience adopting the mantle of the elegant and infamous Parisienne.About the speakers:Elaine Sciolino is a contributing writer and former Paris bureau chief for The New York Times, based in France since 2002. Her latest book, The Seine: The River That Made Paris, was a Los Angeles Times bestseller and a Barnes & Noble nonfiction book-of-the-month selection. Her previous book, The Only Street in Paris: Life on the Rue des Martyrs, published in 2015, was a New York Times best seller. Sciolino was decorated chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 2010 for her “special contribution” to the friendship between France and the United States.Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who grew up in Rome before moving to Paris as a teenager, was nominated for a César for the 1985 comedy and runaway hit, “Trois Hommes et un Couffin.” Over the years, she has played roles as varied as Charlotte Corday (Marat’s assassin during the French Revolution), a drug addict, a Russian aristocrat, a psychopathic doctor turned police officer, and a Polish-Jewish émigré in World War II France. More recently, she has been known for playing the beautiful ambitious wife of Mathias Barneville, the most senior agent, in Cédric Klapisch’s Dix Pour Cent.*The discussion will be available both online and in person. While the conversation will happen in person (Leroy-Beaulieu and Sciolino will appear in the Reading Room), the Library will stream the conversation on Zoom for a live viewing experience.

What better place to recognize this event than in Atlanta? The city known as the hometown of Martin Luther King Jr. became the epicenter for the civil rights movement when black leaders fought for voting rights, access to public facilities and institutions, and economic and educational opportunities for African Americans from 1940 to 1970. To this day, the city’s civil rights legacy lives on in many of Atlanta’s neighborhoods with historic homes and churches, murals, festivals, and museums that cement Atlanta as a civil rights hub.To mark the occasion, the Consulate General of Switzerland is partnering with Civil Bikes to host a Black Heritage Bike Tour of Atlanta! The tour is a unique opportunity to explore the unseen and unheard stories about Atlanta from your bike, being completely immersed in the vibrancy of the city. After the active portion on the bike, we will conclude the event with a meet-up at the WERD / Madame CJ Walker Museum, the first radio station in the United States owned and operated by Black Americans.Two Bike Tours to choose from:Adventurous Bike Tour (Locations: Sweet Auburn, West End, Washington Park- 11 miles): This tour travels across town beginning in Sweet Auburn, transversing downtown, over to the west side anchored by Washington High, the first public high school serving Black Atlantans opening in 1924.

And when Trump won in November, celebrated journalist Audrey Edwards did just that. Inspired by a history of Black Americans leaving the United States for France in search of social and political liberation, Edwards left the country to both protest Trump and to protect her well-being as a Black woman. Her new book, American Runaway: Black and Free in Paris in the Trump Years, chronicles the life she made for herself abroad.A witty, captivating, and moving work, American Runaway captures Edwards’s sharp voice and dry humor. Filled with fabulous soirées, kooky characters, complicated friendships, and the occasionally messy cultural exchange, the work is simultaneously accessible and vulnerable. It broaches the varied challenges known by all expats of leaving one’s home behind, as well as the particular experience of a Black woman “of a certain age” in the City of Lights. Ultimately, Edwards offers a triumphant story of self-liberation.About the speakers:Audrey Edwards is a journalist and author whose work, over the course of her career, grapples with issues of race and gender. A former Executive Editor of Essence and Vice President of Editorial Operations at Black Enterprise, Edwards has worked with figures such as Oprah Winfrey and Maxime Waters to make the work and experiences of Black women accessible to mass-media audiences. She is the author of Children of the Dream: The Psychology of Black Success and The Man from Essence: Creating a Magazine for Black Women, among other works.Ellen Wright-Hervé is the French granddaughter of Black writer Richard Wright, who lived and worked in Paris as an expatriate for much of his life. Born in Accra, Ghana to parents who worked with Kwame Nkrumah for Ghana’s independence, Wright-Hervé has since lived in Lagos, London, Rennes, Tours and presently Paris. In addition to work dedicated to training in hospitals, she works actively in the city to preserve her grandfather’s legacy as a writer and cultural figure. She is currently conducting research on his life and work.*The discussion will be available both online and in person. While the conversation will happen in person (Edwards and Wright-Hervé will appear in the Reading Room), the Library will stream the conversation on Zoom for a live viewing experience.

Historically, France has been celebrated for its colorblind ethos, which favors equality over difference. However, recent discussions have highlighted the ways the colorblind approach ignores socio-political structures and undervalues the particularities of the Black experience. Alan Govenar’s documentary, Myth of a Colorblind France, arrives at a pertinent moment in this debate. Detailing both historical African American artists who saw France as a place of refuge from American racism, and the experience of immigrants and people of color in present-day France, Govenar offers a rich picture of Black history in France while also criticizing oversimplified narratives depicting France as a racial utopia.Ultimately, the film invites us to reflect on the nature of myth: what myth is, how it can be put to use, and how we can simultaneously find truth and falsity in it. From figures such as Josephine Baker, James Baldwin, and Richard Wright, to contemporary artists such as musician Karim Toure, Govenar’s tone is neither naïve nor damning, but rather celebratory of Black life and art.About the speakers:Alan Govenar is a writer, folklorist, and visual artist. He is the author of eighteen books, including Osceola: Memories of a Sharecropper’s Daughter, which won First Place in the New York Book Festival and was awarded a Boston Globe-Hornbook Honor. Also a photographer and film-maker, his film Stoney Knows How was selected as an Outstanding Film of the Year by the London Film Festival.A native of Houston, Texas, Dr. Monique Wells is the founder and CEO of the Wells International Foundation which works to empower individuals, especially women and persons of African descent. As an African-American resident of Paris, veterinary pathologist and toxicologist, world traveler, entrepreneur and arts enthusiast, Dr. Wells knows there is a great need to expose Paris-based minorities to educational and cultural opportunities that will allow them to have a richer, more rewarding life.*The discussion will be available both online and in person. While the conversation will happen in person (Wells will appear in the Reading Room and Govenar will appear on Zoom), the Library will stream the conversation on Zoom for a live viewing experience. Both in-person and online attendees will be able to pose questions. The conversation is organized and co-sponsored by Little Africa Paris."

While the official date is January 6th, nowadays the galette des rois is sold throughout most of January.The cake is made of puff pastry and filled with frangipane. Traditionally, French pâtissiers will hide little charms inside the cake and the person who finds the charm in their slice gets to be crowned King/Queen. My liability insurance deductible is way too high for that and so we'll be skipping that part.😂Pairings for the galette des rois will be Demi Sec Champagne-Mailly Demi-Sec Grand Cru-Veuve Clicquot Demi Sec Champagne-Schramsberg Crémant Demi-SecCost- $25 pp-Zelle- joelle108@gmail.com or Joelle Gracia-PayPal- joelle108@gmail.com-Google Wallet- JOELLE GRACIA-Venmo- Joelle GraciaPlease note that I only have space for a very small group.

Just bring a good bottle of wine or Champagne to share. Address will be sent 1 day before to confirmed RSVP's. Je vous attend !What is Raclette?Raclette (pronounced rah-kleht) originated from the French border of Switzerland hundreds of years ago. It is also the name of the cheese used to make the dish. Farmers and herdsman would make the meal by melting cheese over a campfire or hearth, and then scrape the melted portion onto bread and/or potatoes. Traditionally prepared over a fire, the once-simple raclette meal has evolved to include more ingredients such as cornichons and vegetables. Like the coziness of sitting around a fire together, grilling at the dining table with family and friends encourages relaxed conversation with a fun cooking experience.The usual friendly reminder...please leave those factory brands such as Sutter Home, Cook's, Andre, Beringer, Cupcake, Charles Shaw, Korbel, Menage A Trois, Oak Leaf, Foxhorn, etc on the bottom shelf where they belong.

On the day of the event, you'll receive an email directly from Heygo with the link to join the tour. You can also go to the Heygo website (link above) and join from there.About the tour:Join Florent where the Parisians like to go during the Christmas time with their children: the Grands Boulevards of Paris. Every year, thousands of Parisians go on the Grands Boulevards to see the special decorations and the different shows prepared for the children. Let’s explore the Grands Magasins such as the Printemps and the Galeries Lafayette which provide every year wonderful animations especially for the children who gather by thousands to discover enchanting windows. We will also see the magnificent Christmas Illuminations and the giant Christmas tree. These are the favorite places of the Parisians at the end of the year, follow Florent for a tour to witness the magic of the Christmas time in Paris!About our guide Florent:It's an understatement to say Florent knows Paris. Born in this wonderful city, Florent says he confidently knows every nook and cranny. Having completed over 2000 tours, we believe him. He's a self-declared history, art, and archaeology fan. What he loves most is sharing the best parts (and secrets) of Paris with you! “In French, if you add two letters to Paris, it becomes Paradis (Paradise in English)” he laughs. And paradise, it truly is. Be it exploring Paris' gastronomical delights or catching an auction, walking along the River Seine (which Florent gallantly swam), exploring spots where Hemingway lived or its sprawling gardens, Florent takes you on an exciting tour through his favorite city. “I love sharing my discoveries, explaining the boisterous history of Paris and showing places that are very hard to find otherwise, and of course getting to know new people every day!” Florent says."

They are today, the favourite gardens of the Parisians on the Left Bank of Paris.The gardens, which cover 25 hectares of land, are split into French gardens and English gardens. Between the two, lies a geometric forest and a large pond, where generations of Parisian children played with sailing boats.With 106 statues spread throughout the park, including a version of the Statue of Liberty and the statues of the queens of France, the gardens offer a variety of works of art and are the home of the Luxembourg Museum, the oldest major fine arts museum in France.The beautiful Luxembourg Palace, the former Palace of the queen, with its classical architecture from the 17th century, is now the home of the French Senate.Exploring the gardens allows us to discover other various impressive buildings such as the Orangerie, a greenhouse and the monumental and recently renovated Medici fountain.Join Florent and stroll with him in his favourite gardens of the Left Bank!"

But the Oakland Cemetery Halloween tour is apparently a very popular event in Atlanta and sells out every year, with tickets selling out as early as July. Halloween weekend is already sold out! So if interested, you are welcome to book your space following the link provided above. Meetup is for Thursday Oct 28th, with ticket entry for 6:15pm.About this eventCapturing the Spirit of Oakland Halloween tours are a favorite autumn tradition in Atlanta, selling out every year in July. The event returns for its 15th year bigger and better than ever, offering three weekends of history and delight.Designed to enlighten rather than frighten, Capturing the Spirit of Oakland tours bring to life the stories of some of the cemetery’s notable and notorious residents and allow visitors to experience Oakland Cemetery after dark. A costumed docent guides you through the cemetery’s beautifully-lit Victorian Gardens where you’ll meet some of Oakland’s most notable residents. The evening also includes musical performances, and guests are encouraged to arrive in costume to set the mood.About Oakland CemeteryOakland Cemetery is one of the largest cemetery green spaces, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. Founded as Atlanta Cemetery in 1850 on six acres of land, it was renamed in 1872 to reflect the large number of oak and magnolia trees growing in the area.The original 6 acres of Oakland remains one of the oldest historical plots of land in Atlanta, most of the rest of the city having been burned in 1864. Because of its age and location, the cemetery directly reflects the history and changing culture of the City of Atlanta and the significant events it has seen. Names of Atlanta streets, buildings, parks, subdivisions, and more can be found within the cemetery gates. An estimated 70,000 people are interred at Oakland, and while the last plots were sold in 1884, there are still regular burials today. These are largely conducted on family-owned plots or areas owned by Atlanta (one of the most recent being former mayor Maynard Jackson, whose plot was contributed by the city).What you should know:1) Please ensure you’ve carefully selected your preferred tour date and time (THURSDAY OCT 28, 6:15PM) before completing your transaction, as no refunds or exchanges will be issued.2) Your ticket time is the time you will be admitted into Oakland Cemetery. Once inside, you’ll have time to get a drink, use the restroom, and enjoy the entertainment before your tour begins.3) Capturing the Spirit of Oakland tours last approximately 75 minutes and depart every 15 minutes. The tour route is approximately one mile. Please anticipate that your experience in the cemetery will last at least two hours.4) Total ticket cost includes sales tax and Eventbrite fees.5) Capturing the Spirit of Oakland is a rain or shine event. No refunds will be issued.6) Keep your eyes open. Ticket holders will be sent a list of frequently asked questions in the week before the tours. This will include information about parking, dinner deals with local restaurants, and what you need to know about your experience at Oakland Cemetery.7) We are monitoring COVID-19 guidelines from the City of Atlanta and the CDC and will abide by current best practices. We will notify ticket holders of these practices before the event.8) For more information visit: www.oaklandcemetery.com."

The goal of his group is to create a place for the trumpet’s voice in the modern landscape of music. The synthesis of trumpet, voice, and composition can be found in Collier’s most recent singles, “Buy Your Own Destiny” and “The Grind,” available on Bandcamp.In 2016, Collier was the recipient of the Johnny Mercer Assistantship at Georgia State University. This immersive arranging experience pushed him out of his comfort zone of writing only for small ensembles and required him to research and study the music of Johnny Mercer and the methodologies of big-band arranging. In 2018, he presented five unpublished works from the Johnny Mercer archives with the Georgia State University Jazz Ensemble under the direction of Dr. Gordon Vernick.Collier has performed with ATL Collective and Atlanta Funk Society and is a current member of Ruby Velle and the Soulphonics. He is active in the Atlanta music scene, where he performs, records, and teaches online trumpet and arranging lessons.GENERAL INFORMATION:Seating is extremely limited, and priority is given to guests who have accessibility challenges.Due to the popularity of this event, we ask that you reserve tickets online in advance of your visit.Members enjoy free tickets to Friday Jazz; however, tickets must be reserved in advance.Guest passes are valid for general admission only and cannot be redeemed during this event.No outside food or beverage is permitted.Parking in the Woodruff Arts Center garage is free to members; however, capacity is limited and will be first come first served.

While he struggled to get the piece off the ground — he said he thought he might be written out — it's clear he found his muse in a very big way. He delivered a symphony that continues to delight audiences around the world.Referred to as ""Brooklyn's post-millennial Mozart"" (Time Out), New York-based composer Missy Mazzoli originally composed her Dark with Excessive Bright for the double bass. ""While loosely based in Baroque idioms,"" said the composer, ""this piece slips between string techniques from several centuries, all while twisting a pattern of repeated chords beyond recognition."" Soloist Peter Herresthal — an award-winning violinist — has commissioned a version for violin, which makes its U.S. premiere this weekend.The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra will be implementing a mandatory vaccine policy for audiences. Beginning September 1, 2021, proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to performance, as well as matching photo ID, will be required upon arrival at Atlanta Symphony Hall.

C. Rower, and organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the exhibition focuses on the artists’ exploration of the void, or absence of space, which both defined from the figure through to abstraction.""Electrifying Design: A Century of Lighting emphasizes lighting’s role in propelling innovation in design. Due to the efforts of American and European scientists, inventors, and manufacturers beginning in the late 1800s, electric light bulbs and their attendant fixtures began to pervade domestic and urban life. This ultimately spawned a field that took into consideration both function and aesthetics, sparking wonderment through innovation and the alchemy of light.About Friday Jazz:This is not your typical Friday Jazz. Curated by 400 Proof Music, the event will feature two musical areas where musicians will play throughout the evening, layering notes, improvising melodies, and drawing on inspiration from jazz history.Founded in 2020, 400 Proof Music originates from Atlanta, the Capital of the South. The group was founded by its four key musicians, Ray, Uriel, Marquis, and Moe, who met and formed at a local hotspot, the Atlanta Beltline. With performances each week, they nurtured a unique approach to music to create a “new age of smooth jazz” that included neo-soul, rhythm and blues, Latin, and pop. As their popularity and fans grew, they began playing in other local venues along Georgia State 400, building the foundation for their name 400 Proof Music.Collectively, 400 Proof Music has experience playing alongside other well-known artists such as international jazz pianist Donald Brown, Kirk Whalum, Outkast, Branford Marsalis, and the Georgia Symphony Orchestra, to name a few. The group now comprises the original four founders as well as a collective group of individuals that all bring a distinctive sound to the mix while peppering in original compositions that make the eyes close and head nod in acceptance.As 400 Proof Music continues to grow, they become more than just their music but rather a movement.Safety Precautions:All guests over the age of two, even if fully vaccinated, are required to wear a mask while inside the Museum.In designated outdoor and indoor areas, guests may remove their masks to enjoy a beverage or snack.If weather permits, some of the evening’s performances will take place outside. For outdoor performances, visitors are permitted to bring lawn chairs. Visitors are responsible for storing their lawn chairs in their cars before entering the Museum.General Information:Seating is extremely limited, and priority is given to guests who have accessibility challenges.Due to the popularity of this event, we ask that you reserve tickets online in advance of your visit.Members enjoy free tickets to Friday Jazz; however, tickets must be reserved in advance.Guest passes are valid for general admission only and cannot be redeemed during this event.No outside food or beverage is permitted.Parking in the Woodruff Arts Center garage is free to members; however, capacity is limited and will be first come first served. Members must show proof of membership upon entering the garage: membership card (plastic or digital) or membership purchase confirmation email.For MARTA access, take the train to Arts Center Station (N5), and then follow the signs up to the campus level. For access through Lyft, Uber, or other ride sharing services, follow in-app navigation to the drop-off areas on Callaway Plaza at the corner of Peachtree Street and 15th or on Arts Center Way."

To reserve your tickets please go to this external link- https://high.org/event/august-friday-jazz-3/Alexander Calder and Pablo Picasso are two of the foremost figures in the history of twentieth-century art. This touring exhibition, which debuted in 2019 at the Musée national Picasso-Paris and now at the High this summer, presents more than one hundred paintings, sculptures, and works on paper spanning Calder’s and Picasso’s careers that reveal the radical innovation and enduring influence of their art.Conceived by the artists’ grandsons, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso and Alexander S. C. Rower, and organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the exhibition focuses on the artists’ exploration of the void, or absence of space, which both defined from the figure through to abstraction.Calder’s wire figures, paintings, drawings, and revolutionary nonobjective mobiles, stabiles, and standing mobiles are integrated throughout the exhibition with profoundly inventive works by Picasso in every media. The juxtapositions are insightful, surprising, and challenging, demonstrating the striking innovations these great artists introduced through their ceaseless reexamination of form, line, and space.ABOUT THE JAZZ...This is not your typical Friday Jazz. Curated by Joe Gransden, the event will feature two musical areas where musicians will play throughout the evening, layering notes, improvising melodies, and drawing on inspiration from jazz history.Band leader Joe Gransden has performed worldwide and released sixteen albums. Renowned first for the hard bop approach of his trumpet, Joe’s singing voice has been compared to that of Chet Baker and Frank Sinatra. “When I first heard Joe nine years ago, I immediately thought of Chet,” says Jazziz magazine critic James Rozzi, “but lately his voice has taken on its own style with a deeper resonance. His trumpet has always alternated lyricism with an aggressive, angular approach. He has the ability to cover the gamut of emotions.”Joe is from just north of Manhattan. Coming from a family of musicians, Joe was introduced to music early through his father, a gifted singer and pianist. His grandfather was a trumpeter of merit, playing professionally his whole life throughout New York, and on his mother’s side of the family was the piano virtuoso Carmen Cavallero.Not long after high school, Joe went on the road as a sideman with the big bands of Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller. After eventually moving back to New York City, he performed with numerous groups, including Toshiko Akiyoshi and Chico O’Farrill at the famous Birdland Jazz Club. Meanwhile, he formed his own group, which performed in Brooklyn each week and included the venerable guitarist Joe Cohn and former Betty Carter bassist, Matt Hughes.Like many developing jazz musicians, Joe’s early influences, which include Kenny Dorham and Miles Davis, were easily recognizable in his playing throughout his formative years, and his legion of fans have obviously taken note. Joe currently plays all over Atlanta and the country and recently released a big-band album titled Go Getta, featuring saxophone great Kenny G on the title track. The album can be found on Joe’s website or through anywhere music is sold."

To register please visit the external link here- https://www.heygo.com/tours/the-versailles-palaceAbout the tourThe Palace of VersaillesLocated in the largest royal domain in the world, the Palace of Versailles was built in the 17th century for Louis XIV, the Sun King.More than 50 years and the work of up to 36000 workers a day were needed to build the 2300 rooms of the baroque Palace which inspired so many others in Europe.Follow Florent and visit the King’s State Apartment, the gorgeous Hall of Mirrors as well as the Queen’s Apartment and the Hall of the Coronation.In this tour, you will learn how was the life in the Court under the Sun King’s reign, the longest in France, as well as many not so known anecdotes about Louis XIV who chose the sun as emblem.The visit of the Queen’s Apartment will also be the occasion to share the story of Marie-Antoinette, the wife of Louis XVI, in Versailles.Join this tour to visit the most impressive royal Palace in France!About your guide Florent:It's an understatement to say Florent knows Paris. Born in this wonderful city, Florent says he confidently knows every nook and cranny. Having completed over 2000 tours, we believe him.He's a self-declared history, art, and archaeology fan. What he loves most is sharing the best parts (and secrets) of Paris with you! “In French, if you add two letters to Paris, it becomes Paradis (Paradise in English)” he laughs. And paradise, it truly is.Be it exploring Paris' gastronomical delights or catching an auction, walking along the River Seine (which Florent gallantly swam), exploring spots where Hemingway lived or its sprawling gardens, Florent takes you on an exciting tour through his favorite city.“I love sharing my discoveries, explaining the boisterous history of Paris and showing places that are very hard to find otherwise, and of course getting to know new people every day!” Florent says.What to expectGet ready for something special. We’re travelling to Paris with no passport, no plane ticket and no luggage. And yet you’ll experience all the sights, sounds and stories with just your laptop, favorite snack and an amazing content creator.The tour will last about 45 mins and will be live-streamed by your content creator directly from Paris. Forget about slideshows or pre-recorded videos, this is a live broadcast and anything can happen!While on the tour you’ll be able to see a full screen video of your content creator and their surroundings, interact with them and other travellers through the live chat, see where you are in the world on a map and show your appreciation with a tip.Why are they tip-supported?We are running these tours on a tip-supported basis to make them as accessible as possible. They are free to join, but you have the option to leave a tip during the tour.The majority of your tip goes directly to support the channel, while the rest helps Heygo continue to build a place that brings the world closer together."
